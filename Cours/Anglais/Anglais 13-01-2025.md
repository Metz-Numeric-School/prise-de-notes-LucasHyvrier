NIS :
The **National Intelligence Service (NIS)** is South Korea's intelligence agency, established in 1961. Originally named KCIA, it shifted its focus to external threats, counter-terrorism, counter-espionage, and cybersecurity. A major priority is monitoring North Korea’s activities, including its nuclear programs. Directed by the president, the NIS also collaborates with international agencies like the CIA. While crucial to national security, it has faced criticism for interfering in domestic politics, particularly during elections. Reforms since the 2000s aim to enhance transparency and limit its influence over internal affairs. The NIS remains a key player in regional security in Asia.

CIA :
The **Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)** is the United States' primary foreign intelligence agency, established in **1947** under the National Security Act. It operates under the **Director of National Intelligence (DNI)** and focuses on collecting, analyzing, and using intelligence to protect U.S. national security. The CIA's core missions include foreign intelligence gathering, counterintelligence, covert operations, and providing policymakers with global insights. It works exclusively on foreign operations, as domestic intelligence falls under the FBI. The CIA has played a key role in major international events but has faced criticism for controversial covert actions. Despite this, it remains a critical tool for safeguarding U.S. interests abroad.


# How many types of cybersecurity


There are 12 different types of cybersecurity. For example:

1. Network Security

Protects internal networks from unauthorized access, intrusions, and attacks.

- Firewall: Filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules.
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Detects suspicious or malicious activity, and IPS actively blocks threats in real-time.

2. Application Security

Focuses on ensuring applications are free from vulnerabilities and secure throughout their lifecycle.

- Penetration Testing: Simulating attacks to identify and fix weaknesses in applications.
- Secure Coding: Writing code that mitigates vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or SQL injections.

3. Data Security

Protects sensitive data at rest, in transit, and during processing.

- Encryption: Ensures that data is only readable by authorized parties, using algorithms like AES or RSA.
- Backups: Regularly storing data copies in secure locations to prevent loss due to breaches or hardware failure.

4. Cloud Security

Protects cloud-based systems, applications, and data.

- Infrastructure Security: Ensuring virtual machines, storage, and networks in the cloud are secure.
- Identity and Access Management (IAM): Managing permissions and access to cloud resources using tools like multi-factor authentication.
