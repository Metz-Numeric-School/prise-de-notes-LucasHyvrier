NIS :
The **National Intelligence Service (NIS)** is South Korea's intelligence agency, established in 1961. Originally named KCIA, it shifted its focus to external threats, counter-terrorism, counter-espionage, and cybersecurity. A major priority is monitoring North Korea’s activities, including its nuclear programs. Directed by the president, the NIS also collaborates with international agencies like the CIA. While crucial to national security, it has faced criticism for interfering in domestic politics, particularly during elections. Reforms since the 2000s aim to enhance transparency and limit its influence over internal affairs. The NIS remains a key player in regional security in Asia.

CIA :
The **Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)** is the United States' primary foreign intelligence agency, established in **1947** under the National Security Act. It operates under the **Director of National Intelligence (DNI)** and focuses on collecting, analyzing, and using intelligence to protect U.S. national security. The CIA's core missions include foreign intelligence gathering, counterintelligence, covert operations, and providing policymakers with global insights. It works exclusively on foreign operations, as domestic intelligence falls under the FBI. The CIA has played a key role in major international events but has faced criticism for controversial covert actions. Despite this, it remains a critical tool for safeguarding U.S. interests abroad.
